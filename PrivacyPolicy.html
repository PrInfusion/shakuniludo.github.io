Games of skill are legal, as they are excluded from the ambit of Indian gambling legislations including, the Public Gambling Act of 1867. The Indian Supreme Court in the cases of State of Andhra Pradesh v. K Satyanarayana (AIR 1968 SC 825) and KR Lakshmanan v.

Do you move the same token over and over again until it reaches the end? Or do you move different tokens at different times to ensure that they stay safe and away from the opponent’s tokens? Or do you use your token to kill the opponent’s tokens? How to manage your tokens on the safe points (stars) to let it unaffected by the opponent’s token

Ludo is a game where a lot of concentration, planning, strategy to understand the opponent's planning is required to win a game.

A player with good experience & understanding of ludo skills with the best strategy building skills along with the excellent presence of mind can dominate.
